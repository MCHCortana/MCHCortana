Hello there! 👋

I`m working on developing web aplication in React with TypeScript and I am succesfully tackling JAVA as well. 
I'm proficient in transfering graphical designs into HTML/CSS and giving them life with JavaScript frameworks.
As a Junior Developer, I lack the experience in the field, but I compensate for this with passion and a desire to learn through self-study and development of personal projects.
Currently, I'm learning advanced React techniques and heading towards expanding my technical skills with JAVA and ANGULAR. 
I am seeking an opportunity to join a team where I can professionally grow and apply my skills on real-world projects.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning and growing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA Spring Boot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything on which i could show of what I have already learnt and where I can learn more. 
- 📫 How to reach me? wolokika@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Pokemon are the GOAT.
